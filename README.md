# PIZZA_SALES_ANALYSIS_USING_SQL

🔍 In this project, I leveraged SQL to analyze a comprehensive dataset of pizza sales. The key objectives were to extract meaningful insights and provide data-driven answers to business questions. Here’s what I accomplished:

📊 Retrieved the total number of orders placed and calculated overall revenue.
🍕 Identified the highest-priced pizza and the most commonly ordered pizza size.
🏆 Ranked the top 5 most ordered pizza types and analyzed their quantities.
🔗 Used table joins to explore category-wise pizza distributions and total quantities.
⏰ Studied order patterns by hour of the day and grouped orders by date to calculate daily averages.
💰 Determined the top 3 pizza types by revenue and their percentage contribution to total revenue.
📈 Analyzed cumulative revenue trends and performed category-specific revenue analysis.
Key Skills Utilized:
SQL queries, joins, grouping, aggregation, and revenue trend analysis.

This project enhanced my ability to interpret data and create actionable insights, demonstrating the power of SQL in business analytics.
